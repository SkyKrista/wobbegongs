            <h3>Where are they located?</h3>
            <p>Wobbegongs can be found in many places however here are some of the most common:
                <ul>
                    <li>Western Pacific Ocean off Eastern Indonesia (Waigeo, Aru)</li>
                    <li>Papua New Guinea</li>
                    <li>Northern Australia including Barrow Island off Western Australia,</li>
                    <li>Northon Queensland</li>
                </ul>
                It is often observed residing in the northern Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. There has been a reported occurrence in waters off Malaysia, however this is considered questionable. </p>

        <p>As you can see from the image above Wobbegongs eat all sorts of reef fishes and sharks, this is due to it's very pointy teeth</p>
